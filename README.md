# Version Control using Git and GitHub - Repository Setup, Branching, and Merging

Hands-on assignment to practice initializing a repository, connecting to GitHub, branching, committing, and completing a pull request workflow.

## Learning Goals
- Initialize and configure a local Git repository.
- Connect to a remote on GitHub using SSH or HTTPS.
- Create and merge feature-update with meaningful commits.
- Practice pull request etiquette (description, reviewers, status checks).

## Prerequisites
- Git installed locally and authenticated with GitHub.
- An editor/IDE and terminal access.

## Tasks
1) Prepare your environment and initialize the repository.
2) Set the default branch to 'main', configure your Git identity, and push the initial commit to GitHub.
3) Create a branch name of feature-branch; add or modify files; commit with clear messages.
4) Push the branch to GitHub and open a pull request with a clear description.
5) Address review feedback (if any), then merge the branch back to 'main'.

## Workflow Tips
- Commit early and often with descriptive messages.
- Use 'git status' and 'git log --oneline --graph' to stay oriented.
- Keep branches focused on a single change to make reviews easier.

## Submission
- Ensure the merged 'main' branch on GitHub contains your final work.
- Share the repository URL and the pull request link (even if already merged).
